Ex 1
Refer to attached ex1.pdf which summarizes the cataloging of the
human genome. The key aspect of the genome is that there is only
a 1% difference among humans and so if we take a reference of a
common DNA we can compress the data by only keeping track of the
differences.

Ex 2
Run ex2.py and it will print the RMSE and then display the histogram
using two hardcoded books.

Ex 3
Run ex3.py and it will print the total words, average word length,
average word count, and average file size.

This could be expanded to as many books as necessary in a sample,
however this code runs linearly and so would need to be parallelized
for a sample of sufficient size.

Ex 4 (Optional)
Completed as a part of ex 3.
