Ex 1
===============================================================================
Refer to attached ex1.pdf which summarizes the cataloging of the human genome.
The key aspect of the genome is that there is only a 1% difference among humans
and so if we take a reference of a common DNA we can compress the data by only
keeping track of the differences.

===============================================================================
Ex 2
===============================================================================
Run ex2.py and it will print the RMSE and then display the bargraph, and
histogram using two hardcoded books.

This script also takes IDs for each book as arguments
It will only show the RMSE for the first two books (if at least two are
specified.)

===============================================================================
Ex 3
===============================================================================
Run ex3.py and it will print the total words, average word length, average word
count, and average file size.

This could be expanded to as many books as necessary in a sample, however this
code runs linearly and so would need to be parallelized for a sample of
sufficient size.

Ex 4 (Optional)

Completed as a part of ex 3.

EX 1 SAMPLE OUTPUT:
===============================================================================
