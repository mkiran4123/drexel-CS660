# Overview
The overall focus of this lab is to be able to run make from the Lab2 directory to see the entire
lab's requirements fulfilled in a single command.

The below outlines each sub-task's assignment, what target fulfills that tasks requirements and
any documentation that maybe related.

# Part 1
## Map/Reduce and Generators
1. Run the examples from the lecture on Generators, Delayed Evaluation and Functional Programming
	- Run Make (default target in either this directory or Part1 directory)
	- Output files are called "words_output.log" and "word-count_output.log"
    - Corresponds to Part1/Makefile target "demo"
2. Write a prime number generator using yield
    - Part1/primes.py has been updated to include this feature.
    - Corresponds to Part1/Makefile target "primes"
3. Implement map(f, L) where f is a function and L is a list by constructing a list
4. Implement map using yield
5. Implement map by creating an iterator object
