# Part 1 
## Map/Reduce and Generators
1. Run the examples from the lecture on Generators, Delayed Evaluation and Functional Programming
	- Run Make (default target in either this directory or Part1 directory)
	- Output files are called "words_output.log" and "word-count_output.log"
2. Write a prime number generator using yield
3. Implement map(f, L) where f is a function and L is a list by constructing a list
4. Implement map using yield
5. Implement map by creating an iterator object
