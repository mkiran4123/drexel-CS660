# Overview
The overall focus of this lab is to be able to run make from the Lab2 directory to see the entire
lab's requirements fulfilled in a single command.

The below outlines each sub-task's assignment, what target fulfills that tasks requirements and
any documentation that maybe related.

# Part 1
## Map/Reduce and Generators
1. Run the examples from the lecture on Generators, Delayed Evaluation and Functional Programming
	- Run Make (default target in either this directory or Part1 directory)
	- Output files are called "words_output.log" and "word-count_output.log"
    - Corresponds to Part1/Makefile target "demo"
2. Write a prime number generator using yield
    - Part1/primes.py has been updated to include this feature.
    - Corresponds to Part1/Makefile target "primes"
3. Implement map(f, L) where f is a function and L is a list by constructing a list
4. Implement map using yield
5. Implement map by creating an iterator object

# Part 2
## MRJob
1. Run the examples from the lecture on Introduction to Map/Reduce with MRJob
2. Use MRJob to count letter frequencies
    - refer to Part2/letter_freq.py
3. Use MRJob to sort words by frequency
    - refer to Part2/word_freq.py
4. [extra] Use MRJob to find the k most frequently occurring words
    - Makefile target Part2/k_words accomplishes this by piping through sort -rn -k2
